## Features üåü

1. **Data Upload & Exploration**:
   - Upload datasets in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet).
   - Preview and explore data with summary statistics and missing value analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values using methods like Mean, Median, Mode, KNN Imputer, and more.
   - Detect and handle outliers using IQR or Z-Score.
   - Apply feature scaling techniques like Standard Scaler, MinMax Scaler, and Robust Scaler.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Perform feature transformations like Log Transform, Square Root, and Polynomial.
   - Reduce dimensionality using PCA or feature importance.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train models for Classification, Regression, and Clustering tasks.
   - Supports models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, K-Means, and more.
   - Tune hyperparameters and evaluate models using cross-validation.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Visualize model performance with metrics like Accuracy, MSE, R2 Score, and Silhouette Score.
   - Explain model predictions using SHAP, Feature Importance, and Partial Dependence Plots.

6. **Model Deployment**:
   - Export trained models as `.pkl` files.
   - Generate FastAPI code for deploying models as REST APIs.
